# PS3andNaviToBle

This great work is thanks to aguaviva!!! [https://github.com/aguaviva/PS3ToBle](https://github.com/aguaviva/PS3ToBle). 
Made by combining jvpernis [https://github.com/jvpernis/esp32-ps3](https://github.com/jvpernis/esp32-ps3) and [https://github.com/lemmingDev/ESP32-BLE-Gamepad](https://github.com/lemmingDev/ESP32-BLE-Gamepad).

- I changed a few things to help my PS navigation controller work, like R1, L1, R2 trigger, L2 trigger, R3, L3.

- Display the ESP32 Bluetooth MAC address on the serial monitor

- I also stopped supporting GASIA devices because it didn't work that way.

If you want to use the L,R buttons on GASIA devices, try using the PS3andNaviToBle.ino file here with the libraries [https://github.com/aguaviva/PS3ToBle/tree/main/libraries](https://github.com/aguaviva/PS3ToBle/tree/main/libraries).

You may need to use older ESP32 libraries.
